Overview
Axum basically only provides routing and request handling
most of it other functionalities are provided by other crates like the tower crate etc.

Axum uses;
- hyper for handling all the http bits
- tower for handling everthing that has to do with middleware and the like
- tracing for anything that has to do with logs

Router is the primary entry point to an axum application,  

Panics inside handlers are isolated from each other, whereby a panic in a handler doesn't
affect the entire web application.
